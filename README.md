## üìò Usage Guide

### Workflow
The standard workflow for MetaScreener includes the following steps:

#### 1. Initial Configuration
- Visit the homepage to understand system overview
- Navigate to "Configure LLM & Start" or directly to "View Screening Actions"

#### 2. LLM Configuration (`/llm_config`)
- Select LLM provider and model
- Enter API key (will be stored in current browser session)
- Confirm key status (Not set/Using environment default/Set)
- Save configuration

#### 3. Screening Criteria Setup (`/criteria`)
- Select appropriate criteria framework for your research (PICOT, SPIDER, etc.)
- Define Include, Exclude, and Maybe conditions for each framework element
- Optionally use advanced mode to customize AI prompts and output format
- Save criteria or reset to default examples as needed

#### 4. Screening Action Selection (`/screening_actions`)
- Interface provides links to different screening modules

#### 5. Abstract Screening (`/abstract_screening`)
- Upload .ris file
- Optionally filter literature by title keywords or line number range
- Perform test screening (on a sample), view detailed performance metrics
- Perform full dataset screening, view results and download

#### 6. Full-text PDF Screening (`/full_text_screening`)
- **Single PDF Mode**: Upload, screen, view results (including extracted text and PDF preview)
- **Batch PDF Mode**: Upload multiple PDFs, filter/remove selected files, filter by filename or upload order, process in parallel, view and download batch results

#### 7. Data Extraction (Beta) (`/data_extraction`)
- Define custom data fields to extract from a single PDF

### Best Practices
- **Framework Selection**: Choose appropriate screening framework based on research type:
  - PICOT: Suitable for intervention studies
  - PICOS: Suitable for systematic reviews
  - PECO: Suitable for epidemiological studies
  - SPIDER: Suitable for qualitative research
- **Test Screening**: Always run test screening on a sample first to validate AI decision quality

### Data Flow
1. **Input Processing**:
   - RIS files parsed into pandas DataFrame via `rispy`
   - PDF files have text extracted via `PyMuPDF`+`Tesseract OCR`
   - User criteria submitted via web forms, stored in session

2. **AI Processing**:
   - Build prompt = system prompt + screening criteria + text content + output format requirements
   - Submit prompt through selected LLM's API
   - Parse API response, extract decision label and explanation

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Batch tasks use `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create thread pool
   - Tasks assigned to threads, asynchronously execute API calls
   - Results streamed to frontend via SSE

4. **Result Management**:
   - Temporary results stored in application memory (dictionaries/cache)
   - PDF file results use `TTLCache` (2-hour expiration)
   - Long-term cached data periodically cleaned via background tasks

5. **File Cleanup**:
   - Batch processing PDFs deleted immediately after processing
   - Single-file preview PDFs periodically cleaned via `APScheduler` tasks
   - Session data cleared when browser session ends

## üîí Security and Privacy

- **API Key Handling**:
  - Keys stored only in current browser session
  - Automatically cleared after session ends
  - Not persistently stored on server backend
  - Transmitted via HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

- **File Handling**:
  - Uploaded files temporarily stored on server
  - Batch processing PDFs deleted immediately after processing
  - Single file PDFs retained for a few hours at most before deletion
  - Filenames use UUID prefixes to prevent conflicts

- **Session Security**:
  - Uses Flask's secure session mechanism
  - Session key configured via environment variable
  - Prevention of session fixation attacks
  - Regular session rotation

- **Input Validation**:
  - File type validation
  - File size limitations
  - Filename security handling
  - Content type validation

- **CORS Policy**:
  - Cross-origin request limitations based on deployment environment
  - Appropriate content security policy settings
  - Prevention of unauthorized API calls

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

- **Concurrent Processing**:
  - ThreadPoolExecutor manages parallel API calls
  - Batch tasks automatically load balanced
  - Dynamic thread count adjustment based on server load

- **Caching Strategy**:
  - TTLCache for PDF processing results
  - LLM configuration and screening criteria cached in session
  - Avoids reprocessing identical content

- **Chunked Processing**:
  - Large RIS files processed in batches
  - Large PDFs use paging strategy
  - Stream transmission for long processing task results

- **Resource Management**:
  - Timely cleanup of temporary files to free disk space
  - Memory usage monitoring and optimization
  - Regular garbage collection of expired cache data

- **Background Task Scheduling**:
  - APScheduler manages periodic maintenance tasks
  - Non-critical operations executed asynchronously
  - Smooth handling of load peaks

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

1. **API Key Configuration Issues**
   - **Problem**: API key not saved or invalid
   - **Solution**: Confirm API key is correct and properly saved in session; check account balance is sufficient

2. **File Processing Errors**
   - **Problem**: RIS file parsing failure
   - **Solution**: Ensure RIS file uses correct encoding format (UTF-8); verify file structure conforms to standards

3. **PDF Text Extraction Issues**
   - **Problem**: Incomplete PDF text extraction results
   - **Solution**: Confirm PDF is not scanned or image-based; check Tesseract OCR installation is correct

4. **LLM Response Parsing Errors**
   - **Problem**: LLM returned content cannot be correctly parsed into decision labels
   - **Solution**: Adjust output format instructions; check LLM response completeness

5. **Batch Processing Performance Issues**
   - **Problem**: Batch processing becomes slow or times out
   - **Solution**: Reduce batch processing scale; adjust thread count; check network connection stability

6. **File Upload Failures**
   - **Problem**: Large PDF upload fails (413 error)
   - **Solution**: Check `client_max_body_size` parameter in Nginx configuration; adjust Flask upload limits

7. **Session Expiration Issues**
   - **Problem**: Results lost after screening interruption
   - **Solution**: Periodically save partial results; reduce batch processing scale

8. **Deployment Issues**
   - **Problem**: Gunicorn startup failure
   - **Solution**: Check dependency installation completeness; verify permission configuration; check logs for detailed error information
