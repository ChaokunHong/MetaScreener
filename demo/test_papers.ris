TI  - Antimicrobial stewardship programs in intensive care units: a systematic review
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat in ICU settings. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in reducing resistance rates and improving patient outcomes in adult ICU patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for RCTs and observational studies comparing ASPs with standard care. Results: 23 studies met inclusion criteria. ASPs significantly reduced antimicrobial consumption and resistance rates without increasing mortality.

TI  - Effect of early antibiotic de-escalation on mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis
AB  - Objective: To determine whether early antibiotic de-escalation reduces mortality in adult ICU patients with sepsis. Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial. Setting: 12 ICUs across 8 hospitals. Participants: 840 adult patients with confirmed sepsis. Intervention: Protocolized antibiotic de-escalation within 72 hours versus standard duration. Main outcome: 28-day all-cause mortality. Results: De-escalation was associated with reduced antimicrobial resistance emergence (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85) without increased mortality.
